## HEEEEEEERE'S Johnny! 

Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. 
Connect with nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 5221. Files can be found here: passwd shadow. 

``` $ ./unshadow password shadow > johnnypass

    $ ./john --show  mypasswd
    root:password1:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    
    $ nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 5221
    Username: root
    Password: password1
    picoCTF{J0hn_1$_R1pp3d_289677b5}
```
